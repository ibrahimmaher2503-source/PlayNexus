# Test Results

## 2026-09-10 Laravel foundation scaffold

### T03 review correction verification

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Default tests | `php artisan test` | Pass: 2 tests, 2 assertions |
| Frontend build | `npm run build` | Pass: Vite production build |
| Application timezone | `php artisan config:show app` | Pass: `timezone .. UTC` |
| Diff | `git diff --check` | Pass: no whitespace errors |
| Documentation | `python tools/validate_documentation.py` | Pass: 30 Markdown files, 0 errors, 0 warnings |

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| PHP | `php -v` | Pass: PHP 8.4.21; target is PHP 8.5 |
| Composer | local Composer PHAR `--version` | Pass: Composer 2.10.3 during scaffold; fresh checkout requires Composer on `PATH` as documented |
| Framework install | local Composer PHAR `install --no-interaction` | Pass: dependencies installed and autoload generated; reproducible command is now `composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --no-progress` |
| Node/npm | `node --version`; `npm --version` | Pass: Node 24.15.0, npm 11.12.1 |
| Frontend install | `npm install --ignore-scripts` | Pass |
| Key | `php artisan key:generate --force` | Pass during initial scaffold only; clean setup now generates a key only when `.env` is absent |
| Tests | `php artisan test` | Pass: framework default PHPUnit tests (2 tests, 2 assertions) |
| Assets | `npm run build` | Pass: Vite production build |
| MySQL | `mysql --version` | BLOCKED: MySQL CLI unavailable; no database migration run. This does not determine whether a database service is available elsewhere. |
| Smoke | `php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000` + `curl.exe --max-time 20 -o NUL -w '%{http_code}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/` with temporary file session/cache override | Pass: HTTP 200. With configured MySQL-backed sessions, `127.0.0.1:3306/playnexus` refused a connection during this check; no service was installed, restarted, or altered. |
| Diff | `git diff --check` | Pass: no whitespace errors |
| Documentation | `python tools/validate_documentation.py` | Pass: 30 Markdown files, 0 errors, 0 warnings |

The entries above prove only the installed framework scaffold, default PHPUnit harness, frontend build, and file-session/cache route smoke. They do not prove MySQL migrations/runtime, tenant isolation, authorization, money/time correctness, security, or business workflows.

## 2026-09-10 T04 tenant/branch foundation

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Focused foundation tests | `php artisan test --filter=TenantBranchTest` | Pass: 4 tests, 14 assertions |
| Full tests | `php artisan test` | Pass: 6 tests, 16 assertions |
| Formatting | `vendor/bin/pint --test` | Pass after `vendor/bin/pint` formatting |
| Frontend build | `npm run build` | Pass: Vite production build |
| Documentation | `python tools/validate_documentation.py` | Pass: 30 Markdown files, 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| Diff | `git diff --check` | Pass: no whitespace errors |
| Database | SQLite in-memory via `phpunit.xml` | Pass: constraints and behavior covered; MySQL migration/runtime BLOCKED_BY_ENVIRONMENT (no MySQL CLI/service verified) |

## 2026-08-24 documentation QA

| Check | Real result |
|---|---|
| Compare original and re-attached PRD with SHA-256 | Pass: both 27,198 bytes; hash `D9119C1A3325DD8DBF318296EB52DDFF95B064A0C0061EAD96CAAD68D9FEF5D2` |
| `tools/validate_documentation.py` with PyYAML | Pass after adding `DESIGN.md`: 29 Markdown files, 199 SRS IDs, 50 stories, 14 use cases, 24 OQs, 56 OpenAPI paths/70 operations; 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `python -m openapi_spec_validator docs/contracts/openapi.yaml` | Pass: OpenAPI 3.1 contract OK |
| `tools/smoke_wireframes.cjs` | Pass: 15 screens, desktop/tablet/narrow and RTL layouts, unique IDs, labels/accessibility names, and no console errors |
| Python compile and Node syntax check for QA scripts | Pass |
| Scope/tool artifact scan | Pass: 0 PostgreSQL/psql references and 0 Word/DOCX artifacts or generators |
| Design fallback color contrast check | Pass for the approved non-purple/non-cream palette: primary text `14.34:1`, muted text `5.44:1`, primary action pairs `5.90:1`, and semantic text pairs `5.25:1` or better |
| Final ZIP content audit | Pass after adding `DESIGN.md`: 34 entries, all required artifacts present, and 0 Word/DOCX, QA-output, generator, duplicate-summary, or `__pycache__` entries |

These checks validate documentation structure and the static contract/prototype only. They do not demonstrate application behavior, migrations, tenant isolation, money/time correctness, security, or release readiness; those require the Laravel scaffold and real tests.

The first post-move OpenAPI and browser commands could not load their isolated validator and Playwright dependencies from the default shell. They were rerun successfully with the workspace's bundled Python/Node runtimes and isolated QA dependencies; no specification or wireframe defect caused those environment failures.

## 2026-09-10 decision synchronization QA

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `python tools/validate_documentation.py` | Pass: 30 Markdown files, 199 SRS IDs, 50 stories, 14 use cases, 24 OQs, 56 OpenAPI paths/70 operations, 0 errors/warnings |
| `python -m openapi_spec_validator docs/contracts/openapi.yaml` | Not run: validator package is unavailable in the default Python runtime; rerun with the bundled QA environment before scaffold merge |
| Contract synchronization | Pass: approved receipt, guardian-verification, and pricing amendments added to SRS, architecture, ERD, permissions, API, OpenAPI extension, wireframes, testing, milestones, checklist, and `.ai/` records |
